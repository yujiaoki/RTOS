Please remember to follow these steps:

compile the module with make

be sure to be superuser

	sudo su

install the module with
	
	insmod simple.ko

check the major number that has been assigned with 

	cat /proc/device 

create a special device file with the proper <major> number that has been automatically assigned and minor number = 0

	mknod /dev/simple c <major> 0

compile the read-final.c with

	g++ read-final.c -o read

compile the write-final.c with

	g++ write-final.c -o write

then execute 

	./write in one window

open another shell with

	xterm

and finally run

	./read 

in the new window.

Please remember that, in this example, read must be executed after write, otherwise the shared memory will be empty.
